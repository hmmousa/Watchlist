# Watchlist

## Synopsis
An Android application for managing a list of movies to watch. This was done as part of an intensive 1 week introduction course and then 3 weeks time to complete the project. It's my first touch to Android platform and Android studio IDE but I think the application turned out well in the given timeframe.

## How it works
The user adds in movies to the application by search. The search results comes from [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and get stored in a SQLite database. When the user has seen a movie from his list, he can delete that entry.
